# Rc-planes-live-map
Android application for viewing rc planes in real map

Τhis project is related to the pilot’s ability to monitor the flight path of his rc plane on a map via a mobile phone in real time !
The pilot connects through a small ESP32 board linked to their transmitter (TX16 and others).

Using the Android application, the pilot can view the planes’s route as well as the positions of real airplanes flying in the area, helping to avoid potential hazards. No adsb required !
Additionally, the system can connect with other transmitters located nearby to enable live flight relaying.

Anyone who has the application installed, and logged in as a registrated user, will be able to view the flight of all binded rc planes in real time !
An additional feature is that, as mentioned, multiple pilots can connect with each other to fly in formation or engage in chasing, allowing them to “locate each other.” 
The screen includes a dashboard that displays the distance and altitude of the two aircraft, while an audio alert is also provided so pilots don’t have to constantly look at their phone.
The mobile application is still under development, and more features will be added later.
